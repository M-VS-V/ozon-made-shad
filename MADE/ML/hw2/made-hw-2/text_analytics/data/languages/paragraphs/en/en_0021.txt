Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit warring".[81][82] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.[83] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[84] conflict based[85] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[86] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
