Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[62] On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree.[63][64] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.[65] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[66]
