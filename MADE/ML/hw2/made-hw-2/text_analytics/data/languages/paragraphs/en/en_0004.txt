The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001[22] and January 13, 2001[23] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[14] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[24] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[18] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[25] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[18] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[26]
