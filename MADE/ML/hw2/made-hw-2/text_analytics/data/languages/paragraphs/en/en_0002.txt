Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and exhibiting systemic and gender bias, where the majority of editors are male. However, edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[10] In 2006 Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability. In 2018 Facebook and YouTube  announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.[12].mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}
